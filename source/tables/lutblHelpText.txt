1	frmRFIRouting	View RFI	View a print-preview of the current RFI.
2	frmRFIRouting	Cancel RFI	You can cancel an RFI at any point in the process. Typical reasons to cancel an RFI: 1) the information requested is no longer required; 2) the information was received prior to the RFI being transmitted.
3	frmRFIRouting	Submit RFI to Concurrence	Once draft RFI is complete, submit to secondary review for RFI concurrence. The RFI Item Type will dictate who must complete concurrence: RPA = PAGS; Project = PDM.
4	frmRFIRouting	Concurrence Review Complete	Marks the letter signed and indicates who completed the review. The RFI Item Type will dictate who must complete concurrence: RPA = PAGS; Project = PDM.
5	frmRFIRouting	RFI Transmitted to Applicant	Date the RFI was transmitted to the Applicant is required.
6	frmRFIRouting	Assess Information Received	Opens RFI Item Assessment Form. First, the date each requested item is received is noted (typically by the PDM). This generates a task to the creator of the RFI to assess whether or not the item is accepted (i.e. does it satisfy the reason requested?)
7	frmRFIRouting	RFI Complete	Marks the RFI fully satisfied / closed. This will return the RFI to the originating review. The creator of the RFI will be assigned this task. NOTE: Please coordinate with Lane Lead to determine if the project needs to be reworked to a review other than the originating review.
8	frmRFIResponseAssessment	Requested Item Received	This task is typically completed by the assigned PDM. This generates a task to the creator of the RFI to assess whether or not the item is accepted (i.e. does it satisfy the reason requested?).<br/> <br/> If the item is not accepted by the RFI assessor, the applicant should be notified of the deficiency and need to resubmit the item. <br/> <br/>Additionally, in the case where a response is not accepted, the task will be reworked to "Pending Receipt" by the RFI assessor.
9	frmRFIResponseAssessment	Requested Item Assessed	If the response is  accepted, Submit upon review. <br/> <br/>If the response is not accepted, rework back to "Pending Receipt". The RFI assessor must provide comments regarding how the deficiency can be appropriately addressed by the Applicant. <br/> <br/>Once all items have been accepted, mark the RFI complete.
10	frmRFIResponseAssessment	About This Form	You may need to click the left-most tab to bring the appropriate item into focus before completing your review. <br/> <br/> A blue button indicates that the review is pending.  <br/> <br/>If both the "Item Received" / "Item Assessed" button are gray then there are no available reviews. This typically means that the reviews for that item are complete, but can also mean that the RFI was been canceled.
11	frmRFIRouting	Item Requested	About Holds: "Holds" indicate the furthest point a PW can progess without the RFI being satisfied by the Applicant. <br/> <br/>For example, if an Applicant has completed work prior to project formulation, FEMA would need the applicant to provide sufficient documentation of the damages. Because Damage Eligibility / Analysis occurs in phase 2, a project should not progress beyond phase 2 without this information being provided. <br/> <br/>"Hold in DVS Review" is used in the case where an item is required prior to Site Inspection.  <br/> <br/>Be cognizant of the holds placed by the items you are requesting. For circumstances where the given hold is not appropriate, use the "Other" item with the desired hold. If no hold is required, it may be likely that the RFI is not required. If you need to modify a hold after an RFI is transmitted, please see your PARIS Admin.
12	frmRFIRouting	RFI Uploaded to EMMIE	To be completed by DIU after transmission of RFI to Applicant.
13	frmRFIResponseAssessment	Sync Main RFI Form	If the main RFI Form is not visible or is showing information for a different RFI, use this button to sync.
14	frmRFIRouting	Item Deletion	You may delete unecessary items in "RFI Creation" by right-clicking the left-most tab (directly below this icon) and selecting "Cut."
